## About this course

Programming for Problem Solving ESC-18104 is the first course in computer language, for Engineering Students at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana.

It does not expect any prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by Dr. Hardeep Singh Rai. teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Language used is C. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming.

Students need to solve 9 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project, in addition to many scheduled or surprise  Quizes and two scheduled mide semester tests.

Students are expected to maintain a minimum of 80% attendance separaetly in lectures, tutorials and lab.

Students are expected to abide by the terms of the Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDE) honour code.

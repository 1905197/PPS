## About this course

Programming for Problem Solving ESC-104 is the first course in computer language, for Engineering Students at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College, Ludhiana.

It does not expect any prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by Dr. Hardeep Singh Rai, teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include introduction to computer system, algorithms, branching, loops, array, function, recursion, structure, pointer and file handling. Language used is C.

Students need to solve 10 problem sets (i.e., programming assignments) and a final project, in addition to many scheduled and / or surprise  Quizzes and two scheduled Mid Semester Examinations.

Students are expected to maintain a minimum of 80% attendance separaetly in lectures, tutorials and lab.

Students are expected to abide by the terms of the Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College (GNDE) honour code. GNDEC will take appropriate corrective action in response to violations of the GNDEC honour code, which may include dismissal from the course, fine, or other remedies as circumstances warrant. No refunds will be issued in the case of corrective action for such violations.

GNDEC is committed to maintaining a safe and healthy educational and work environment in which no bonafide student is denied the benefits of, or subjected to discrimination or harassment. All members of the GNDEC community are expected to abide by GNDEC policies on nondiscrimination, including sexual harassment, and the other terms and conditions approved by Academic Council and the Management.

## Unit 1: Introduction to Programming (4 lectures)

1. Introduction to components of a computer system:
    - Disks
    - Memory
    - processor
    - Where a program is:
        - stored and
        - executed
    - Operating system
    - Compilers
    - etc.

            (1 lecture).

1. Idea of Algorithm:
    - Steps to solve logical and numerical problems.
    - Representation of Algorithm (with examples):
        - Flowchart
        - Pseudocode

                (1 lecture).

1. From algorithms to programs:
    - source code
    - variables (with data types)
    - variables and memory locations
    - syntax and Logical Errors in compilation
    - object and executable code

          (2 lectures).

## Unit 2: Arithmetic expressions and precedence (2 lectures)

## Unit 3: Conditional Branching and Loops (6 lectures)

1. Writing and evaluation of 
    - conditionals and
    - consequent branching

            (3 lectures).

1. Iteration and loops (3 lectures).

## Unit 4: Arrays (6 lectures)

1. Arrays
    - 1-D
    - 2-D
    - Character arrays and Strings

## Unit 5: Basic Algorithms (6 lectures)

Searching, Basic Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion and Selection), Finding roots of
equations, notion of order of complexity through example programs (no formal definition
required)

## Unit 6: Function (5 lectures)

Functions (including using built in libraries), Parameter passing in functions, call by value,
Passing arrays to functions: idea of call by reference

## Unit 7: Recursion (4 -5 lectures)

Recursion, as a different way of solving problems. Example programs, such as Finding
Factorial, Fibonacci series, Ackerman function etc. Quick sort or Merge sort.

## Unit 8 Structure (4 lectures)

Structures, Defining structures and Array of Structures

## Unit 9 Pointers (2 lectures)

Idea of pointers, Defining pointers, Use of Pointers in self-referential structures, notion of
linked list (no implementation)

## Unit 10 File handling

(if time is available, otherwise cover in lab)

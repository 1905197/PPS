# Unit 1: Introduction to Programming (4 lectures)

1. Introduction to components of a computer system:
    - Disks
    - Memory
    - processor
    - Where a program is:
        - stored and
        - executed
    - Operating system
    - Compilers
    - etc.

        (1 lecture).

1. Idea of Algorithm:
    - Steps to solve logical and numerical problems.
    - Representation of Algorithm (with examples):
        - Flowchart
        - Pseudocode

        (1 lecture).

1. From algorithms to programs:
    - source code
    - variables (with data types)
    - variables and memory locations
    - syntax and Logical Errors in compilation
    - object and executable code

        (2 lectures).

# Unit 2: Arithmetic expressions and precedence (2 lectures)

Unit 2:Conditional Branching and Loops (6 lectures)
Writing and evaluation of conditionals and consequent branching (3 lectures)
Iteration and loops (3 lectures)
Unit 3Arrays (6 lectures)
Arrays (1-D, 2-D), Character arrays and Strings
Unit 4Basic Algorithms (6 lectures)
Searching, Basic Sorting Algorithms (Bubble, Insertion and Selection), Finding roots of
equations, notion of order of complexity through example programs (no formal definition
required)
Unit 5Function (5 lectures)
Functions (including using built in libraries), Parameter passing in functions, call by value,
Passing arrays to functions: idea of call by reference
Unit 6Recursion (4 -5 lectures)
Recursion, as a different way of solving problems. Example programs, such as Finding
Factorial, Fibonacci series, Ackerman function etc. Quick sort or Merge sort.
Unit 7Structure (4 lectures)
Structures, Defining structures and Array of Structures
Unit 8Pointers (2 lectures)
Idea of pointers, Defining pointers, Use of Pointers in self-referential structures, notion of
linked list (no implementation)
Unit 9File handling (only if time is available, otherwise should be done as part of the lab)
